# Panel Data of Individual Wages Analysis
This is an open-book test completed in R and PowerPoint.
I highlighted three descriptive facts from the data with supporting analysis and graphsã€‚
I found out the logarithm of wage is slightly leptokurtic & negative skew distributed.
I built and compared three regression models to determine the relationship between wage and other attributes, like experience, education and so on.
